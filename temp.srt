00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:01,950
Uh

00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:10,080
You don't have to be beautiful

00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,480
To turn me on

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,790
I just need your body, baby

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,300
From dusk till dawn

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:31,330
You don't need experience

8
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,370
To turn me out

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,460
You just leave it all up to me

10
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,690
I'm gonna show you what it's all about, yeah

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,920
You don't have to be rich to be my girl

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,280
You don't have to be cool to rule my world

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,580
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with

14
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:02,260
I just want your extra time and your

15
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:02,430
Kiss

16
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:02,830
Ah, oh

17
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:10,760
You gotta not talk dirty, baby

If you wanna impress me (ah, ah)

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,050
You can't be too flirty, mama

21
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,890
I know how to undress me, yeah

22
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,880
I want to be your fantasy

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,430
Maybe you could be mine

24
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,060
You just leave it all up to me

25
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,200
We could have a good time, uh

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,470
You don't have to be rich to be my girl

Yes

Oh

33
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,350
I think I wanna dance

34
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,540
Uh

Women, not girls, rule my world

00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:54,330
I said they rule my world

44
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,080
Act your age, mama (not your shoe size), not your shoe size

45
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,960
Maybe we can do the twirl

46
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,920
You don't have to watch Dynasty

47
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,370
To have an attitude, uh

48
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,020
You just leave it all up to me
